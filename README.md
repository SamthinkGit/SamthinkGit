# âœ¨ Hi! I'm Sam, an AI + Software Engineer

I'm passionate about designing adaptive AI architectures that push boundaries. My focus is on creating algorithms that interact intelligently with their environment to build robust, autonomous solutions.

## âš¡ About Me

- **AI + Robotics Engineering Student** focused on software development and AI behaviors.
- **Agentic AI Architectures**: Designing intelligent agents using frameworks like **AutoGPT** and **LangChain**.
- **AI and Robotics**: Combining **ROS2** with AI for adaptable systems.

## ðŸ“š Skills & Tools
- **Programming**: Python, C/C++, Java, bash/powershell, JavaScript, CSS/HTML
- **AI Frameworks**: LangChain, Transformers, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, OpenAI APIs
- **Robotics**: ROS2, rclpy, rviz2

## ðŸŒŸ Recent Achievements
- Developed **AI tools and plugins for Powershell/Bash** based on **Llama2**: ([llama2-terminal](https://github.com/SamthinkGit/llama2-terminal)).
- Created a **runtime Python analyzer** with **LangChain agents**: ([aiuda](https://github.com/SamthinkGit/aiuda)).
- Published a guide for **Llama 2** deployment on Windows: ([Llama2-Guide](https://github.com/SamthinkGit/llama2-for-windows)).
